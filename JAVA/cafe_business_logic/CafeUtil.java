//** Method 1: Get Streak Goal
/**int getStreakGoal()

Cafe Java wants to implement a reward system for customers who always buy more drinks than they did the week before. To calculate how many drinks they need after 10 weeks, write a method that sums together every consecutive integer from 1 to 10 and returns the sum. In other words, add 1 + 2 + 3.. and so on up to 10 and return the result.

Test your code before moving on! Don't forget to make an instance of your 
CafeUtil class to use in the test file. The number printed should be 55.

**Ninja Bonus:  Add a parameter, numWeeks so that an admin can change the number from 10 to whatever they want.

a.) The index, b.) The menu item at that index, and c.) The price at that index. 
Finally, return true.

/**
 ** Method 4: addCustomer(ArrayList<String> customers)

Inside this method:

Print this string to the console: "Please enter your name:"
Then add this line of code to get user input from the terminal and store it in the variable  userName: 
String userName = System.console().readLine();copy
Next print the userName to the console, saying "Hello, [user name here]!"
Next print "There are ___ people in front of you" using the number for how many people are ahead of them (how many items already in the array)
Then, add the customer's name to the given customers list. And print the list.
No need to return anything.

/**
 * *MORE NINJA BONUSES
* *Given a product, price and a maxQuantity, create a method that prints the cost for buying 1, then the price for buying 2, then for 3.. and so on, up to the max. For example, if the product is "Columbian Coffee Grounds" with a price of 15.0 and maxQuantity of 3, you should print:
* *Columbian Coffee Grounds
    ** 1 - $15.00
    ** 2 - $30.00
    ** 3 - $45.00
**Tip: You can use the escape character \n within your string for line breaks.
**Sensei bonus:  Format the prices as currency. Hint: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html

**enpai Bonus: Take $0.50 more off of the original price every time the quantity increases. Example: Given a $2.00 price and 4 max, where the prices would normally be $2, $4, $6 and $8, the discount would yield $2, $3.50, $5, and $6.50, progressively taking off $0.50, then $1, then $1.50 from the group tag price:
